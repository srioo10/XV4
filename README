ChronoFS: Time-Versioned File System for xv6
ChronoFS is a modified file system for the xv6 teaching operating system that adds copy-on-write versioning, snapshots, and advanced file recovery on top of the original xv6 file system.​

Project goals
ChronoFS aims to:

Prevent data loss from accidental deletes or overwrites by keeping past versions of files.

Allow “time-travel” access to previous file states and system-wide snapshots.

Improve crash resilience with journaling while staying simple enough for educational use.​

Core features:

Copy-on-write (CoW) file versioning.

Per-file version history and time-based recovery.

System snapshots (named points-in-time).

Integration with a file recovery mechanism.
